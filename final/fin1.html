						<p class="abthidden" style="text-indent: 25px;"> 	Once upon a time, my mom, a breeder cat, escaped and ran to a farm. My human grandma, who worked with the horses there, found her and decided to bring her home. The barn owners thought she was wild. <br> &emsp; My human grandma didn't know my mom was pregnant. She ended up having four kittens, and I was one of them! After our spay and neuter appointments, we discovered my mom is an F1 Bengal, and Iâ€™m an F2 Bengal! Surprise!<br>	&emsp; My mom and two sisters live with my human grandma, and I live with her son, his wife, their baby...and Deacon.</p>

					<div class="abtchunk"><button class="button-53" role="button">Why I like to Harass Toddlers</button>
						<p class="abthidden">&emsp; Well, honestly, I like harassing toddlers because its so much fun! My human family has a little girl, and I love to head-butt her, steal her binky, and use my human-like paws to open her door in the night to meow over her crib. It's especially fun when I don't even sound like a cat, but instead an otherworldly creature! <br> &emsp; You think she would have learned how to feed me by now...</p>
